<h3>Features added in this version</h3>

<ul>
    <li>the "auto hang-up" - needs to be enabled from the "settings" card</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The new "auto hang-up" allows me to be more proactive regarding your incoming calls. With
    this option enabled, I won't have to wait for the call to be missed or rejected, rather I
    will send the SMS as sons as I detect your activity and hang-up the ongoing call right after.
