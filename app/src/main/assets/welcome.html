<h3>Hi, my name is Peggy.</h3>

<p>
    I would like to take up on the challenge of being your personal assistant while you are engaged
    in activities like <b>biking</b>, <b>driving</b> or <b>running</b>.
</p>

<h3>What I will do for you</h3>

<p>
    If you receive a phone call and you <b>miss it</b> or <b>reject it</b> and if I detect you are
    engaged in one of the activities listed above, I will automatically send an SMS to the caller
    with a custom message configured for each type of activity. Moreover, you can configure me
    to be more proactive using the the "auto hang-up" feature - with this option enabled, I won't
    have to wait for the call to be missed or rejected, rather I will send the SMS as sons as
    I detect your activity and hang-up the ongoing call right after.
</p>

<p>
    You have full control over what I do:
<ul>
    <li>enable/disable with a click of the button in the toolbar</li>
    <li>configure the activities you are interested in</li>
    <li>configure the contacts I should send automatic SMSes to</li>
    <li>configure the SMS text for each type of activity</li>
    <li>enable/disable the "auto hang-up" feature</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>How I will go about all this</h3>

<p>
    I am awaken by the start of a received phone call. If the caller is configured for me,
    I will start detecting what you do. If I accurately detect you are engaged in one
    of the activities you have interest in and the call was missed or rejected, I will automatically
    send the custom message configured for that type of activity. Besides, if the "auto hang-up"
    option is enabled, I won't wait for the call to be missed or rejected. Rather I will send the SMS
    as sons as
    I detect your activity and hang-up the ongoing call right after.
</p>

<p>
    If I've already sent a message to the current caller in the previous 5 minutes, I won't send
    a new message.
</p>

<p>
    If I'm unable to detect what your activity, I will stop the detection after 1 minute so I don't
    drain your battery.
</p>

<p>
    One last thing, I don't keep any data outside of your phone. All the detection is happening on
    your device
    and all the data is kept locally so you know what I've done. You can browse my activity and take
    extra actions
    for the callers or simply delete my activity logs by swiping.
